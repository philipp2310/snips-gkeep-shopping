# SNIPS Google Keep Shopping List (DISCONTINUED)

As there is still no Keep Api and the reveres engineered one is very unstable, I decided to use Bring! shopping list instead.
Please see: https://github.com/philipp2310/snips-bring-shopping

This skill for SNIPS takes two parameters for shopping Lists:

The first one is your current list

The second one is your personal sorting order - your main list can be sorted by that list. When you make a change to your current list, you can update the sorting order for future lists with just one command.

## Setup

Fill in the two shopping lists numbers:
TODO

Set up your (app) login data for google:

## Usage
